# WindowsBasicSocket: A Primer in Socket Programming for Windows

Welcome to WindowsBasicSocket, a repository that provides fundamental insights into socket programming within the Windows environment. This collection features simple yet effective C socket programs designed to elucidate the basic principles of network communication and interaction between different computer systems.

This project, created and maintained solely by myself, focuses on two key elements:

1. **TCPClient.c**: This program is designed to run on a client computer, making requests to another computer (the server) via TCP/IP protocol. It serves as a basic representation of a client in the client-server model of network architecture.

2. **TCPServer.c**: This program, designed to run on the server computer, responds to the client's request. It demonstrates the foundational principle of a server's role in the client-server model. Upon receiving a request from the client, it responds with an HTTP 1.1 header bearing the message: "Hello World! This is the simplest web server."

## Objective

The primary goal of this repository is to provide a practical, hands-on understanding of socket programming in C, specifically within the Windows environment. The focus is on creating functioning client and server programs and understanding the underlying principles and mechanisms of network communication.

This repository is intended to serve as a valuable self-learning resource for beginners taking their first steps into network programming and experienced programmers who wish to refresh their understanding of the basics.

## Usage

Ensure that you have a Windows environment set up to run C programs. Once you have the environment ready, you can run TCPClient.c on one computer (the client) and TCPServer.c on another computer (the server). The client will send a request to the server, and the server will respond with the HTTP 1.1 header message.

Thank you for your interest in WindowsBasicSocket. I hope this repository will be a beneficial resource in your journey through network programming.
